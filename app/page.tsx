                The modern economy allocates goods and services mostly based on supply and demand. That 
                demand is largely driven by human desires and revealed preferences: US consumer spending is fairly 
                stable at around 70% of GDP<sup className="text-sm">[1]</sup>. Meanwhile, supply is also heavily driven by human labor (both 
                manual and cognitive): the share of US GDP directed towards paying for labor has stayed 
                remarkably stable at around 60% for over a century<sup className="text-sm">[2, 3]</sup>.<sup className="text-sm"> 1</sup> These statistics reflect the nature of the 
                modern economy: it is primarily a system of humans producing goods and services for other 
                humans, with human preferences and human capabilities driving the majority of both supply and 
                demand.

                To give a concrete example, individual consumers in economically developed areas can reliably 
                purchase coffee. This is possible because of the labor of countless individuals now and in the past, 
                mostly motivated by self-interest, to create and maintain a sophisticated system of production, 
                transportation, and distribution â€” from farmers and agricultural scientists to logistics workers and 
                baristas. As a consumer, the economy appears to helpfully provide goods and services. This apparent 
                alignment occurs because consumers have money to spend, which in turn is mainly because 
                consumers can perform useful economic work.<sup className="text-sm"> 2</sup>

                But AI has the potential to disrupt this dynamic in a way that no previous technology has. If AI 
                labor replaces human labor, then by default, money will cease to mainly flow to workers. I 
                elaborate on the consequences of this change in the remainder of this section.
